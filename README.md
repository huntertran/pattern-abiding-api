Design a pattern abiding RESTful API - A proof of concept
---

For the last decade, the information presented on theInternet has varied from a simple static web page to interactiveweb applications that can be customized and react to useractions. Users increasingly require more functions on a webapplication, make it more complicated than ever. Addressing thisissue, Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural stylewas introduced to separate the concern of resource serving withHyperText Markup Languages development. Since then, RESTAPI became a trend for the new web applications. The researchesof patterns and anti-patterns, as well as how to design a simplebut effective REST API, became a hot spot. In this research, we present some new (anti)-patterns and propose some architecturedesigns to make a RESTful API conform with these patterns.

This repository contains sample implementations of the patterns proposed in that research.
