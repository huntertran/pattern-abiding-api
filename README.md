Design a pattern abiding RESTful API - A proof of concept
---

REST APIs are nowadays the de-facto standard for Web applications. However, as more systems and services adapt REST architectural style, many problems arise regularly. To avoid these repetitive problems, developers could follow good practices and avoid bad practices. Thus, research on best and bad practices and how to design a simple but effective REST API is important. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few concrete designs to recurring REST API practices, like "API Versioning". There are works on defining or detecting some practices, but not on designs to the practices. We present the most up-to-date list of REST API practices and propose designs, in the form of anti-patterns, to make a REST API compliant. We validate our anti-patterns with a survey and interviews of 55 developers.

This repository contains sample implementations of the patterns proposed in that research.
